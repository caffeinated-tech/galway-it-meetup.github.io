This [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/galway-information-technology/events/302439331/) was held on Wednesday 21st of August at the [PorterShed](https://www.google.com/maps/place/PorterShed/@53.2734788,-9.0534656,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x485b96e5c4af853f:0x3535a8060a8c257d!8m2!3d53.2734788!4d-9.0534656!16s%2Fg%2F11c0xpjshy?entry=ttu) on Market Street.


The event was sponsored by [Liberty IT](https://www.liberty-it.ie/careers/career-opportunities) and the [PorterShed](https://portershed.com/). A huge thank you to Ben, Darren and Padraig of Liberty IT, Mary and the team from the PorterShed as well as the speakers Graeme, Saurab and Nino.


We had three speakers who gave two excellent talks on the topics of cloud computing:

- **"Transforming CX: Building Quality Experiences with AI"** by [Graeme Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graeme-richard-james-brown/) & [Saurab Chandel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurab-chandel-6b16a91a/)
- **"Code generation (Automatic Programming)"** by [Nino Musanovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ninomusanovic/)


It's wonderful to see such a great turnout of enthusiastic people. It was great to meet new members and some familiar faces too. Looking forward to the next event already.
