Join us 25th September for GIT 2.4, where we're chatting Web Analytics and Accessibility. Have you ever been overwhelmed by Google Analytics? Want to make your website reach the right people? Make it easy to use for everyone? This might just be the event for you.

We are hosting the following talks:

Turning Data into Brand Decisions By [Kalpitha Gowda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalpitha-gowda/)
The Accessible Web by [Liam Krewer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liamkrewer/)

Followed by plenty of time to network, socialize and chat.

RSVPs are appreciated, as they let us plan for attendance! You can sign up on [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/galway-information-technology/events/311044311/) or [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/git-25-web-analytics-accessibility-tickets-1704514943079) - whichever platform you prefer.

If you'd like to give a talk - at this or any future events - give us a shout on hello@galwayit.org.

We're also looking for sponsors - both for individual events and long term arrangements. Sponsors help us keep attendees fed and hydrated, supporting local businesses like All About Kombucha where we can. If that's something you or your company are potentially interested in, we'd love to talk to you!
