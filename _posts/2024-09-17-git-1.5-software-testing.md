We had two wonderful talks on Software Testing

- **"Synthetic Testing - The Art of Faux Testing"** by [Jamiu Salimon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dkmdebugin/)
- **"Building Testable Apps"** by [Liam Krewer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liamkrewer/)


It's wonderful to see such a great turnout of enthusiastic people. It was great to meet new members and some familiar faces too. Looking forward to the next event already.

A Special thank you to all the students who came along for their first meetup, we hope to run more meetups to help you learn and secure internships / graduate positions.
