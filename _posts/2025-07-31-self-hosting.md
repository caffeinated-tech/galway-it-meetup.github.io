![GIT 2.4: Self Hosted](/assets/2.4/poster.png)

We held a meetup on Self Hosting and Home Servers on Thursday, 31st of July @ 6:30 for our [Self Hosted Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/galway-information-technology/events/308821968) at PorterShed a Do, Market Street, Galway/

Our last talk on Home Assistant got us thinking about the other amazing self-hosted tools in our lives, and so we've decided to center our next talk on self hosting!

This time we talked a little about the services and tools we self-host and use every day, and what we love and have learned in the process.

We focussed on a more social aspect this time around, with an introductory talk by Aisling Krewer followed by a Q&A session and break out into individual discussions. We heard a lot of great examples of self hosting services and inspired some new comers to try it out for themselves.

Thank you all for attending.
