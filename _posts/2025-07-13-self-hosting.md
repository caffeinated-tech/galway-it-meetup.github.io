Our last talk on Home Assistant got us thinking about the other amazing self-hosted tools in our lives, and so we've decided to center our next talk on self hosting!

This time we're talking a little about the services and tools we self-host and use every day, and what we love and have learned in the process. 

We're focussing on a more social aspect this time around, but if you love your set-ups as much as we love ours, and would like to live demo on stage or chat about your favourite tools - we want to hear from you! You don't need a slide deck - just reach out to us <a href="mailto:hello@galwayit.org">here via email</a> or any of other usual channels.
