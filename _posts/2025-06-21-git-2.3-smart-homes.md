![GIT 2.3: Smart Homes w/Home Assistant Community Day](/assets/2.3/poster.png)

Our first [weekend meetup](https://www.meetup.com/galway-information-technology/events/308132807/) is scheduled for Saturday 21st June 2025 at the [PorterShed](https://www.google.com/maps/place/PorterShed/@53.2734788,-9.0534656,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x485b96e5c4af853f:0x3535a8060a8c257d!8m2!3d53.2734788!4d-9.0534656!16s%2Fg%2F11c0xpjshy?entry=ttu) on Market Street.

This meetup was originally scheduled for Saturday May 24th, but we unfortunately had to reschedule last minute. 

The meetup is in association with the [Home Assistant Community Day 2025](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/04/24/community-day/). Home Assistant is an Open Source Smart Home hub software which can integrate with and control many smart home devices across mutliple manufacturers and technologies.

Taking a slightly different approach, we will feature a combination of talks and hands-on demos that included hardware from our existing smart home set-ups.
