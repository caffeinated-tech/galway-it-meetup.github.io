This [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/galway-information-technology/events/301885482/) was held on Thursday 18th of July at [Signify Health](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Signify+Health+Ireland/@53.2714904,-9.0513579,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x485b979ce711f47b:0x5f0ebe361d14fcea!8m2!3d53.2714904!4d-9.048783!16s%2Fg%2F11ty98vszs?entry=ttu) in Bonham Quay.
