Our first [weekend meetup](https://www.meetup.com/galway-information-technology/events/307522026/) was held on Saturday 24th May 2025 at the [PorterShed](https://www.google.com/maps/place/PorterShed/@53.2734788,-9.0534656,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x485b96e5c4af853f:0x3535a8060a8c257d!8m2!3d53.2734788!4d-9.0534656!16s%2Fg%2F11c0xpjshy?entry=ttu) on Market Street.
