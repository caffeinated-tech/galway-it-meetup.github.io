## Profile

Hi, I'm Liam, a software engineer from Galway who also co-organizes this meetup. 

I've been working in startups in Galway since graduating from NUIG in 2014. I've mostly worked in web technologies - frontend, backend, cloud, dev-ops, mobile apps etc. 

When working in small companies with few IT people, I really enjoyed community events where I could connect with like minded individuals. After lockdown many of them disappeared, so I took the plunge to organise a community myself.

Galway IT is a community effort, and it's run for you. I need to know what you want so I can best serve our community.
