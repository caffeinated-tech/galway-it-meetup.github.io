# Galway IT Website: [galwayit.org](https://galwayit.org)

This is the website for the Galway IT Meetup Group.
It contains entries for past meetups and contact information for the group.

Hosted on Github Pages using Jekyll.
Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) to setup a dev environment.

If you want to create a new event entry, I recommend copying the most recent one, including the directory for the assets and making changes.
