## Galway Information Technology Group

![GIT 1.5: Placeholder](/assets/placeholder_poster.png)


Welcome to the Galway IT Meetup Group. 

<br/>
We endeavour to meet once a month in Galway to learn, share, network and socialize. Galway has a vibrant and diverse community of tech students, workers, enthusiasts and companies. This group's goal is to provide a place for anyone interested in IT (software, hardware, development, research etc.) to come together and share ideas.

<br/>
We will host and organise any event which our members are interested in. See the list of past events below for some examples, but feel free to suggest something completely different. For 2025 we'd like to branch out into computer hardware and 3D Printing.
