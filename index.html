# Galway IT Meetup Group

## About

Hello,

We are the Galway Information Technology Meetup group.
We hold (semi) regular meetups in Galway, Ireland to network, socialize and learn about technology.
Everyone is welcome, and we are always looking for new members, speakers and sponsors.
Since we started in September 2023, we have hosted events focused on programming, cyber security, game development, women in tech and cloud computing.
